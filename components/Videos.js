					The four separate program-specific events—one for each of the School’s
					areas of graduate study in Sculpture, Painting/Printmaking, Graphic
					Design, and Photography—are available online in six edited videos.
					Beginning with an introduction to MFA admissions across the School of
					Art, the 2021 Admissions Open House playlist then contains the
					program-specific information featuring each department’s faculty and
					students before concluding with an informational session on financial
					aid. We recommend that interested applicants watch the first video,
					“Dean’s Welcome & Preparing Your Application,” followed by the
					video(s) specific to the programs they’re interested in applying to,
					and conclude with “Financing Your Education.” All applications for
					Fall 2022 must be submitted no later than 11:59:59 PM EST on
					Wednesday, January 5, 2022. Visit art.yale.edu/apply for full info.
